# Tic Tac Toe

### Description
Who will win the battle for the Scarlet Witch's power?! Choose your player and battle it out in an epic game of Tic Tac Toe on this week's episode of WandaVision, Wanda vs Agatha.

### How it Works
- Users play the game by choosing their WandaVision character(aka Player 1 or Player 2)
- A winner is announced each time a player gets three of their icons in a row
- If no one wins a round, the game is a draw and neither player receives a point
- The winner's scores are displayed after each win and will persist on page refresh


### Technologies Implemented:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

### Future Updates
- A game restart button
- Local storage clear button
- Reset game without calling a window reset
- Ability to choose player character
